Fundamentals of JavaScript

In this project, I was expected to develop a series of simple JavaScript scripts that demonstrate core programming concepts, such as printing to the console, handling command-line arguments, using conditionals, loops, and performing basic mathematical operations.

Tasks

Print a string
Write a script that prints: "Javascript is amazing"

Print 3 lines
Write a script that prints 3 lines using multiple console.log() statements.

Print a message depending on the number of arguments passed
Write a script that checks the number of arguments provided and prints a message accordingly.

Print the first argument
Write a script that prints the first argument passed to it.

Print two arguments in a formatted string
Write a script that prints two arguments in the format:

Print an integer if convertible
Write a script that prints:
My number: <first argument converted to an integer>
Only if the first argument can be successfully converted to an integer.

Print 3 lines using an array and a loop
Write a script that stores 3 strings in an array and prints them line-by-line using a loop.

Print “C is fun” x times
Write a script that prints “C is fun” a number of times specified by the first argument.

Print a square
Write a script that prints a square of size x using the character X, where x is the first argument.

Print the addition of 2 integers
Write a script that adds two integers passed as arguments and prints the result.

Compute and print a factorial
Write a script that computes and prints the factorial of a number passed as the first argument.
